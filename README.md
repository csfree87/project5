Greetings!

Regretfully this current submission is lacking many things needed to complete the assignment, and the work will continue beyond the basic setup and edits I've made so far. During set up I have relied upon project modules to guide me on initial structures, with the intent to modify and design more specifically upon the next resubmission. 

I've created an e-commerce site focused on selling fragrances, soaps, lotions, and candles and intend to add more options to my completed project. 

This readme file will also be made to standard upon resubmission. I understand there may not be much to provide feedback on, but appreciate any offered and look forward to presenting a much more polished and completed website.
